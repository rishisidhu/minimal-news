## 📝 SESSION 14: Product Page Sources, Card Size & Loading UX

### Summary of Changes

**1. Product Page Source Overhaul**
Multiple iterations to find reliable, fast-loading sources with good content:
- Removed slow blog scrapers (Product School, SVPG, etc.)
- Tried Reddit product subreddits (removed - poor content quality)
- Tried Product Hunt (removed - requires API authentication)
- Tried a16z essays (removed - scraping issues)
- **Final sources: Hacker News, First Round Review, Product School**

**2. Hacker News Scraper Improvements**
- Fetches meta descriptions from article pages for better excerpts
- Falls back to "X points • Y comments" when meta fetch fails
- Uses HN Firebase API for fast story retrieval
- Increased excerpt length from 500 to 1000 characters

**3. Created New Scrapers**
- `lib/scrapers/firstround.ts` - First Round Review VC essays
- `lib/scrapers/productschool.ts` - Product School blog articles
- Both fetch OG meta tags from individual article pages for reliable titles, excerpts, and images

**4. Card Size & Text Length Increases**

Replaced spinning circles with skeleton loading cards on all 3 pages:
- Crypto page: 6 skeleton cards in grid layout
- AI page: 6 skeleton cards in grid layout
- Product page: 1 featured skeleton + 3 regular skeletons
- Shows "Fetching latest articles..." text
- Skeleton cards pulse/shimmer with animate-pulse
- Matches actual card layout for seamless transition

### Files Created (2 files)
1. `lib/scrapers/firstround.ts` - First Round Review scraper
2. `lib/scrapers/productschool.ts` - Product School scraper

### Files Modified (8 files)
1. `app/api/scrape-product/route.ts` - Updated to use HN, First Round, Product School
2. `app/api/news-product/route.ts` - Updated PRODUCT_SOURCES array

7. `lib/scrapers/hackernews.ts` - Increased excerpt length to 1000 chars
8. `lib/scrapers/reddit.ts` - Increased excerpt length to 1000 chars

### Technical Notes
- First Round and Product School scrapers fetch OG meta tags from each article page
- This provides reliable titles, descriptions (150+ words), and images
- Skeleton loading uses Tailwind's animate-pulse for shimmer effect
- Product page skeletons mirror the featured + regular card layout
- HN scraper makes parallel requests to article URLs for meta descriptions

### Source Colors Added
- First Round: teal-600
- Product School: violet-600

- Smaller padding (`px-4 py-2` → `px-3 py-1.5`)
- Smaller text (`text-sm` → `text-xs`)
- Smaller border radius (`rounded-lg` → `rounded-md`)
- Tighter button spacing (`gap-4` → `gap-2`)

### Files Modified (4 files)
1. `components/NewsCard.tsx` - Removed borders, added shadow, increased padding
2. `app/page.tsx` - Consistent nav, compact buttons, increased gaps
3. `app/ai/page.tsx` - Consistent nav, compact buttons, increased gaps
4. `app/product/page.tsx` - Consistent nav, compact buttons, increased gaps

### Technical Notes
- Cards use `shadow-sm` instead of borders for cleaner separation
- Active nav button has `bg-white/20` without hover effects
- Inactive buttons keep hover effects for interactivity
- Grid gaps and section spacing create more breathing room

### Result
The design now feels more spacious and refined with an Apple-like aesthetic. Navigation is consistent across all pages with clear active state indication. The compact buttons are more elegant and don't dominate the header.

## 📝 SESSION 15 (Continued): Homepage Design & Smart Prefetching

### Summary of Changes

**1. Homepage Luxury Design**
Created new minimal homepage with luxury showroom aesthetic:
- Separate homepage (app/page.tsx) with 3 category cards
- Moved crypto content to app/crypto/page.tsx
- Black/white luxury theme with glass morphism
- Extreme letter-spacing (0.15em on title)
- Glass tiles with reflection effects on hover
- Grayscale emojis that colorize on hover
- Spotlight gradient background

**2. Light Mode Vibrancy Improvements**
Enhanced light mode to be less dull while maintaining luxury aesthetic:
- Background spotlight: 2% → 6% opacity
- Logo: 60% → 80% opacity
- Card backgrounds: 5% → 8% opacity
- Card borders: 10% → 15% opacity
- Divider line: 20% → 30% opacity
- Emojis: 60% → 75% opacity
- Text readability improvements across all elements
- Fixed About link bug (was invisible in light mode)

**3. Smart Background Prefetching**
Implemented intelligent content prefetching for instant navigation:
- Created prefetch utility using SWR's preload() function
- Homepage prefetches all 3 sections on load
- Each section prefetches other 2 sections
- Non-blocking background loading
- Shared SWR cache across pages
- Eliminates navigation delay

### Files Created (3 files)
1. `lib/prefetch.ts` - Prefetch utility functions
2. `components/PrefetchNews.tsx` - Background prefetch component
3. `app/crypto/page.tsx` - New file, old homepage moved here

### Files Modified (6 files)
1. `app/page.tsx` - Complete rewrite to luxury homepage + prefetching
2. `app/ai/page.tsx` - Updated navigation links + cross-prefetching
3. `app/product/page.tsx` - Updated navigation links + cross-prefetching
4. `app/crypto/page.tsx` - Added cross-prefetching

### Technical Notes
- SWR's preload() function enables prefetching without rendering
- Prefetch happens in useEffect, doesn't block main page
- About link now uses dark mode variants: `text-black/30 dark:text-white/20`
- Glass cards use arbitrary opacity values: `bg-black/[0.08]`
- Logo clickable on all pages, returns to homepage

### Result
Navigation between sections now feels instant, especially noticeable for Product page. Light mode is more vibrant and engaging while maintaining sophistication. Homepage provides elegant entry point with luxury aesthetic in both light and dark modes.

## 📝 SESSION 15 (Continued): Performance Optimization

### Summary of Changes

**1. Removed On-Mount Scraping**
Eliminated blocking initial scrape on all three pages:
- Removed `isScrapingInitial` state variable
- Removed initial scrape `useEffect` from Crypto, AI, and Product pages
- Pages now show cached database content immediately
- Periodic 5-minute background scraping maintains fresh content

**2. Optimized Hacker News Scraper**
Simplified scraper to eliminate slowest bottleneck:
- Removed external URL meta description fetching (15+ HTTP requests)
- Eliminated unpredictable external site dependencies
- Now uses HN native data: "X points • Y comments" as excerpt
- For Ask HN/Show HN posts, uses original text
- Reduced total HTTP requests from 16+ to 2 per scrape

### Files Modified (4 files)
1. `app/product/page.tsx` - Removed on-mount scraping, removed isScrapingInitial state
2. `app/crypto/page.tsx` - Removed on-mount scraping, removed isScrapingInitial state
3. `app/ai/page.tsx` - Removed on-mount scraping, removed isScrapingInitial state
4. `lib/scrapers/hackernews.ts` - Removed external URL fetching, simplified to 2 requests

### Technical Notes
- Pages now only use `isLoading` from SWR, not custom scraping state
- Prefetching + cached data = instant page loads
- Periodic scraping happens in background without blocking UI
- Hacker News scraper went from async/await Promise.all to simple map

### Result
**Dramatic performance improvement:**
- Product page: 20-30+ seconds → <1 second
- Crypto page: Instant load from cache
- AI page: Instant load from cache
- Total HTTP requests eliminated: 15+ per page visit
- User experience: Instant navigation, background updates
